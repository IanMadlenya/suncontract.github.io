                                                <li><b>Legal risks regarding securities regulations</b><br /> There is a risk that in some jurisdictions the SNCs or other Digital Assets might be considered to be a security, or that it might be considered to be a security in the future. Suncontract does not give warranties or guarantees that SNC tokens are not a security in all jurisdictions. Each User of SNC tokens shall bear its own legal or financial consequences of SNC tokens being considered a security in their respective jurisdiction.
Every User is bound to check if acquisition and disposal of SNC tokens is legal in its jurisdiction, and by accepting these Terms each User undertakes not to use SNC tokens should their use not be legal in the relevant jurisdiction. If a User establishes that the use of SNC under these Terms is not legal in its jurisdiction, it shall neither use the SNC nor acquire them, and should immediately stop using or possessing them if such case arises.
Acquiring cryptographic tokens in possession and exchanging them for other cryptographic tokens will most likely continue to be scrutinized by various regulatory bodies around the world, which have so far given mixed reactions and opinions depending on the jurisdiction. The legal ability of Suncontract to provide SNC tokens and the Platform in some jurisdictions may be hindered or eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event, it turns out with a high degree of certainty that SNC tokens are not legal in certain jurisdiction, Suncontract will either a) cease operations in that jurisdiction, or b) adjust SNC tokens and the Platform in a way to comply with the regulation should that be possible and viable.

As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause the SNC tokens to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum may itself lose value and hence impact the value SNC tokens. Other unforeseeable changes in Ethereum, whether intended or not, may likewise impact the value and usability of SNC tokens.

                                                    Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Ethereum network and associated blockchain networks and Digital Assets and SNC tokens could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like SNC tokens, which could impede or limit their existence, permissibility of their use and possession, and their value.

                                                    As with other decentralized cryptocurrencies, the Ethereum blockchain, which is used for the SNC tokens, is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the SNC tokens, expected proper execution and sequencing of SNC tokens, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum smart contract computations in general. Despite the best efforts of Suncontract and Ethereum Foundation, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists. Mining Attacks, as described above, may also target other blockchain networks, with which the SNC tokens interact with and consequently the SNC tokens may be impacted also in that way to the extent described above.
